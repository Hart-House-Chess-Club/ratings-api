# FIDE API System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the system architecture, deployment strategy, and data flow for the FIDE API project.

## Architecture Overview

The FIDE API system combines multiple data sources and services to provide comprehensive chess rating information:

1. **FIDE Web Scraping**: Scrapes data directly from the FIDE website
2. **Rating List Integration**: Downloads and processes official FIDE and CFC rating lists
3. **MongoDB Database**: Stores structured rating list data for efficient querying
4. **Redis Cache**: Improves performance for frequently accessed data
5. **FastAPI Service**: Provides RESTful API endpoints

## Data Flow

### FIDE Web Scraping Flow

1. Request comes to API endpoint
2. System checks Redis cache for data
3. If not found, scraper requests data from FIDE website
4. Data is parsed, cached in Redis, and returned

### Rating List Flow

1. Scheduled updater checks for new rating lists
2. Downloads ZIP/CSV files from official sources
3. Parses data into structured format
4. Stores in MongoDB with appropriate indexes
5. API endpoints query MongoDB for fast retrieval

## Deployment Strategy

### Container Architecture

The project uses Docker for containerization with three main services:

1. **FIDE API Container**:
   - Python FastAPI application
   - Web scraping modules
   - Rating list parsers
   - Update scheduler

2. **Redis Container**:
   - In-memory cache for web scraping results
   - Improves response time for frequent queries

3. **MongoDB Container**:
   - Persistent storage for rating list data
   - Indexed for efficient queries

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Single Server Deployment (Recommended for Small/Medium Scale)

- Uses docker-compose on a single Linux server
- All containers run on the same host
- Simple maintenance and monitoring

#### Option 2: Distributed Deployment (For Larger Scale)

- API containers can be scaled horizontally
- Shared Redis and MongoDB instances
- Load balancer distributing traffic

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes GitHub Actions workflow for continuous deployment:

1. Code pushed to main branch
2. Tests run automatically
3. Docker image is built and published
4. Deployment script pulls latest image and restarts services

## Data Update Strategy

### FIDE Rating List

- **Source**: Monthly ZIP file from FIDE
- **Update Schedule**: 1st of each month
- **Process**: Download > Extract > Parse > Store
- **Volume**: Approximately 350,000 players

### CFC Rating List

- **Source**: Weekly CSV file from CFC website
- **Update Schedule**: Every Monday
- **Process**: Download > Parse > Store
- **Volume**: Approximately 10,000 players

## Security Considerations

The current implementation includes:

1. **CORS Configuration**: API allows cross-origin requests
2. **No Authentication**: Currently public API without rate limiting
3. **Admin Endpoints**: Should be secured in production

Recommended improvements:

1. Add API key authentication for admin endpoints
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add request logging and monitoring

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Rating Lists**:
   - USCF (United States Chess Federation)
   - ECF (English Chess Federation)

2. **Enhanced Search**:
   - Search by rating range
   - Filter by federation, title, etc.

3. **Historical Data**:
   - Track rating changes over time
   - Provide historical analysis

4. **Authentication**:
   - Add API key authentication
   - User accounts for premium features
